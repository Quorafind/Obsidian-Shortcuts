# Overview

_Move faster in Obsidian with Shortcuts!_

This plugin adds the ability to activate commands using multiple shortcut methods. A scissors icon is added to the status bar and shown as active/inactive to indicate when shortcuts can be used. Right-click on this scissors icon to view your currently assigned shortcuts at a glance.

> [!NOTE]
> When entering shortcuts mode, the plugin listens for all hotkey sequences that are pressed:
> For example, when you press:
> `a` then `b`, it will search if there is an asigned command and then judge if it should trigger a command
> of course, you can use `a+b` then `a` then `a`, and more.
>
> Shortcuts mode will not function when focus is on an input element or the editor.


# Shortcut types
| Shortcut type  | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Single key press | Press a single key to trigger an action | S |
| Multi-key press | Press multiple keys simultaneously to trigger an action | A + B |
| Key press with modifier | Combine a key with a modifier (e.g., Ctrl, Shift, Alt) | Ctrl + V |
| Key sequence | Multiple shortcut types combined in sequence | A then C + B then D (press A, C + B, D in sequence) |

# Features

## Auto-shortcuts mode

With this setting enabled, the ability to activate shortcuts will be enabled at all times, except when the editor or input field is focused.

## Scoped shortcuts

This feature allows a command to be activated by a shortcut depending on the users location within Obsidian. At the moment, shortcuts can be set to trigger in the following scopes:

**General:** the editor, sidebars, graph view

**Editor:** the space where files are read and modified

**UI:** shortcuts which are tied to components of the interface and shows that components shortcut in a tooltip on hover

Additionally, a UI element can have a shortcut set via right-click on the icon button

## Surfing

A special mode that generates a shortcut near any clickable element.
